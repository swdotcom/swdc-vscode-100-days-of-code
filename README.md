## The 100 Days Of Code Challenge

The 100 Days of Code is a coding challenge created by [Alexander Kallaway](https://twitter.com/ka11away) to encourage people to learn new coding skills. The challenge follows one simple rule:

-   **Code for at least an hour each day for 100 consecutive days.**

Tens of thousands of developers from around the world have taken on this challenge. Whether you are learning to code or an experienced developer, everyone—of any skill level—can participate in the 100 Days of Code challenge.

We want to do our part to make your experience a little easier (and more fun too!). To get a complete overview of the challenge and why you should join the community, visit the [100 Days of Code official website](https://www.100daysofcode.com/), or check out our [Essential Guide to the 100 Days of Code](https://www.software.com/src/essential-guide-to-the-100-days-of-code-challenge).

## Features

-   **Track your progress**: Log daily progress, metrics, and milestones to see how far you have progressed over the 100 days.

-   **Collect milestones**: Work toward milestones while coding and unlock badges for your accomplishments along the way.

-   **Build your dashboard**: Quickly view your overall milestone progress, recent logs, and overall code time throughout the challenge.

-   **Share your progress**: Easily share your logs and milestones to Twitter.

-   **Backup your data**: Create a free Software account and we’ll back up your coding activity, logs, and milestones so you can pick up where you left off—even if you take a break or switch computers.

The 100 Days of Code plugin is built on [Code Time](https://www.software.com/code-time), our powerful time tracking extension backed by a community of over 70,000 developers.

<br />

## Getting started

### **1. Create your web account**

100 Days of Code requires that you're logged in via Google, Github or Software account. This allows your data to be accessible and synced across multiple devices.

<p align="center" style="margin: 0 10%">
  <img src="https://swdc-vscode.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/login-prompt.png" alt="Code Time for VS Code login prompt" />
</p>

### **2. Create a log entry**

Logs are journal entries for your 100 Days of Code challenge to help you stay on track and remember all of your accomplishments. Each log entry includes a title, description, and set of links that you can add if you want to link to your projects and resources. Logs are also automatically populated with your code time, number of keystrokes, and lines added for that day of coding.

<p align="center" style="margin: 0 10%">
    <img src="https://100-days-of-code.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Readme/Add+Log+Navigation.png" alt="Navigate to add log page for 100 Days of Code" />
</p>

Open the Code Time view in the sidebar and navigate to 100 Days of Code section. Open the **Add Log** page by clicking **View Logs**. Click the **Add Log** link at the top of the new window.

You can only add one log entry per day. Any coding metrics (like code time) recorded after you submit your log entry will be automatically updated in the log. The title, description, and links for any log entry can be edited at any time.

<p align="center" style="margin: 0 10%">
    <img src="https://100-days-of-code.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Readme/Add+Log+Form.png" alt="Add log for 100 Days of Code" />
</p>

Logging your daily progress is important to get the most out of the 100 Days of Code challenge, so this plugin makes it as easy as possible. Input a title, description, and resource links into the Add Log form and we will generate a log for you that includes your code metrics and milestones earned that day.

<br>

### **3. View Logs**

<p align="center" style="margin: 0 10%">
    <img src="https://100-days-of-code.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Readme/View+Log+Page.png" alt="View log for 100 Days of Code" />
</p>

When you submit a log, it is added to your **Logs** page. Here you can view details about each log, including title, description, links, code metrics, and milestones for that day. Each day's metrics are compared to your average metrics calculated from all your log entries throughout the challenge.

If you forget to create a log for a day that you worked, don’t worry! We will automatically create a log for you. It will appear in your logs as **No Title**. You can edit these logs at any time with any additional details that you would like to add.

<br>

### **4. View Milestones**

Milestones are fun, shareable badges that you can earn during the #100DaysOfCode challenge. For example, you can earn badges by coding for 10 hours, coding in a new language, or coding for 30 days in a row.

<p align="center" style="margin: 0 10%">
  <img src="https://100-days-of-code.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Readme/Milestones+Page.png" alt="View milestones for 100 Days of Code" />
</p>

To open the **Milestones** view, click **View Milestones** below the **View Logs** link in the Code Time view of your editor's sidebar.

Milestones are divided into six levels of difficulty. You should complete the level one Milestones within the first few days, the level five Milestones should be completed by the end of the challenge, and the level 6 Milestones are for those who are looking for a little more when the challenge has been completed.

<br>

### **5. View Dashboard**

The **Dashboard** helps you visualize your progress during the challenge. You can view your aggregated code metrics for the challenge, your most recent Logs and Milestones, and a graph of your code time throughout the challenge.

<p align="center" style="margin: 0 10%">
  <img src="https://100-days-of-code.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Readme/Dashboard+Page.png" alt="View Dashboard page for 100 Days of Code" />
</p>

To navigate to the dashboard, click the **View Dashboard** button in the 100 Days of Code section of the Code Time view.

<br>

### **6. Share your progress**

To be a part of the community, it's important to share your progress during the 100 Days of Code challenge. Even minor progress is progress, and we encourage you to share something every day.

<p align="center" style="margin: 0 10%">
  <img src="https://100-days-of-code.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Readme/Log+Tweet.png" alt="Share log to Twitter for 100 Days of Code" />
</p>

Each log entry has a share button that will allow you to directly tweet your progress along with your daily code time metrics. You can also share any of your milestones right from your code editor.

<p align="center" style="margin: 0 10%">
  <img src="https://100-days-of-code.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Readme/Milestone+Tweet.png" alt="Share milestones to Twitter for 100 Days of Code" />
</p>

Tweets about your milestones will include a badge, description, and link for your followers to explore.
